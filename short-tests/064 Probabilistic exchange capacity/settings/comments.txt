      <text>"This example presents interconnections with "</text>
      <text fontweight="92">probabilistic capacities</text>
      <text>, that is to say exchange capacities which can be different from one Monte-Carlo year to another.</text>

    <paragraph>
      <text>"This functionality is made possible thanks to binding constraints which bind "</text>

    <paragraph>
      <text>On the one hand, flows are bounded by the link capacities (direct capacity and indirect capacity). They are deterministic inputs, described by (only) one time-series for every Monte-Carlo year. On the other hand, thermal generations are bounded by the cluster capacities, which are one of the probabilistic input of Antares.</text>
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      <text>By using the binding constraints between flows and thermal generation, it is then possible to transpose the use of a probabilistic input from the thermal generation to the energy flows.</text>

      <text>" and "</text>
      <text fontstyle="93">area-2</text>
      <text>" is linked  to the generation of the cluster "</text>
      <text fontstyle="93">hvdc-area-1-2</text>
      <text>" thanks to two binding constraints. The flow between "</text>
      <text fontstyle="93">area-1</text>
      <text>" and "</text>
      <text fontstyle="93">area-2</text>
      <text>" is thus bounded by the available capacity of the cluster "</text>
      <text fontstyle="93">hvdc-area-1-2</text>
      <text>. The available capacity is described with 10 times series which have been generated by the TS-generator of Antares, using an outage rate of 5%.</text>

      <text>"Here, the cluster "</text>
      <text fontstyle="93">hvdc-area-1-2</text>
      <text>" has 1 unit of 700 MW. In conclusion, the available exchange capacity between "</text>

      <text>" and "</text>
      <text fontstyle="93">area-2</text>
