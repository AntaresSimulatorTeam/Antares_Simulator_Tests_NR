      <text>-&gt; A derated  run on average conditions suggests that the interconnection has no value</text>
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      <text>-&gt; A deterministic run on one Monte-Carlo year shows that the interconnection is actually used and even operated at its maximum capacity for several hours in the year. However the evaluation of some indexes, such as the expected congestion fee or the overall operating cost, is not so good as several Monte-Carlo years should ideally be run for those indexes to converge.</text>
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      <text>"-&gt; A large number of MC years shows that the interconnector is often used at a high rate (though the expectation of the flow is zero). The overall operating cost of the whole system is higher in a thorough probabilistic simulation than in a quick derated one. "</text>
