      <text>In this new model, the operation of the PSP is no longer constrained to fit exactly either a 24-hour cycle or a 168-hour cycle. It is free to optimize throughout the week the number of cycles it performs. The initilial reservoir level at the beginning of week is no longer set to be equal to the ending level of the same week, but to the ending level of the previous week.</text>
