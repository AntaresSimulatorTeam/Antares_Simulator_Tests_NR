      <text>In the frst example, all breakers are closed, which means that some part of the EHV power generated on the west side and expected to supply the demand on the east side</text>
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      <text>is derived through the HV parallel corridor. To avoid congestion of the HV corridor, some expensive generation in REMOTE-E has to be scheduled on, thus preventing to achieve</text>

      <text>In the second example, the breakers of the SWITCH-HV-EAST corridors are open, thus protecting the HV corridor from being congested by undesirable derived flows.</text>

      <text>"As a result, full use of the unexpensive Western generation can be achieved. However, since the SWITCH substation is now  supplied by single line, "</text>
