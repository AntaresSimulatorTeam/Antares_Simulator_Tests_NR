# Study case 13_2 : to test investment problems
# Simple generation expansion problem on one node, one timestep and one scenario with two candidates: one continuous and one discrete.

# Demand = 400
# Generator : P_max : 200, Cost : 45
# Unsupplied energy : Cost : 501

# -> 200 of unsupplied energy
# -> Total cost without investment = 45 * 200 + 501 * 200 = 109_200

# Continuous candidate  : Invest cost : 490 / MW; Prod cost : 10
# Discrete candidate : Invest cost : 200 / MW; Prod cost : 10; Nb of units: 10; Prod per unit: 10

# Optimal investment : 100 MW (Discrete) + 100 MW (Continuous)

# -> Optimal cost = 490 * 100 + 10 * 100 (Continuous)
#                 + 200 * 100 + 10 * 100 (Discrete)
#                             + 45 * 200 (Generator)
#                 =    69_000 +   11_000
#                 = 80_000
