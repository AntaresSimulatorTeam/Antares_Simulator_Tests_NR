# Study case 13_2 : to test investment problems
# Simple generation expansion problem on one node, 3 weeks and one scenario with two candidates: one continuous and one discrete.

# Demand = 400
# Generator : P_max : 200, Cost : 45
# Unsupplied energy : Cost : 501
# Spillage : Cost : 1

# -> 200 of unsupplied energy
# -> Total cost without investment = 45 * 200 + 501 * 200 = 50_509_800

# Continuous candidate  : Invest cost : 490 / MW; Prod cost : 10
# Discrete candidate : Invest cost : 200 / MW; Prod cost : 10; Nb of units: 10; Prod per unit: 10

# Optimal investment : 100 MW (Discrete) + 300 MW (Continuous)

# -> Optimal cost = 490 * 300 + 10 * 300 * 3 * 168 (Continuous)
#                 + 200 * 100 + 10 * 100 * 3 * 168 (Discrete)
#                 =    167_000 +   2_016_000
#                 = 2_183_000
