# Study case 13_1 : to test investment problems
# Simple generation expansion problem on one node, one timestep and one scenario with one candidate.

# Demand = 400
# Generator : P_max : 200, Cost : 45
# Unsupplied energy : Cost : 501

# -> 200 of unsupplied energy
# -> Total cost without investment = 45 * 200 + 501 * 200 = 109_200

# Continuous candidate  : Invest cost : 400 / MW; Prod cost : 10

# Optimal investment : 200 MW

# -> Optimal cost = 400 * 200 + 10 * 200 (Invest cost + prod cost of new generator)
#                             + 45 * 200 (Generator)
#                 =    80_000 +   11_000
#                 = 91_000
