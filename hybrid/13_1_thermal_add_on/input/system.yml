# Study case 13_1_add_on : to test investment problems on thermal cluster legacy with GEMS add on
# Simple generation expansion problem on one node, 3 weeks and one scenario with one candidate.

# Demand = 400
# Generator : P_max : 200, Cost : 45
# Unsupplied energy : Cost : 501
# Spillage cost : Cost : 1

# -> 200 of unsupplied energy on 3 weeks : 3 x 168 time steps
# -> Total cost without investment = 45 * 200 + 501 * 200 * 168 * 3 = 50_509_800

# Continuous candidate  : Invest cost : 400 / MW; Prod cost : 10

# Optimal investment : 400 MW

# -> Optimal cost = 400 * 400 + 10 * 400 * 3 * 168 (Invest cost + prod cost of new generator)
#                 =    160_000 +   2_016_000
#                 = 2_176_000
