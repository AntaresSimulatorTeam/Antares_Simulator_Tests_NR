# The study consists of a single area with:
#  - A leagcy generator of capacity 10 MW, cost 2 €/MW
#  - A legacy load of value 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the first time steps, then 0 for all remaining steps in the week.
#  - A GEMS load of value 11 for all time steps
#  - Spillage and unsupplied energy cost: 1000
#
# The objective is then :
#  - 10 MW of generation at each time step : 10 * 2 * 168 = 3360
#  - Unsupplied energy : 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 1 for 163 time steps = (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 163) * 1000 = 183 * 100 = 183 000
#  ==> Overall cost = 3360 + 183 000 = 186 360
# 
# This test aims at verifying the RHS of the area balance constraint (which is -load in the mps file), 
# it should be : -12, -13, -14, -15, -16 for 5 first hours, then -11 for all remaining 163 time steps.
